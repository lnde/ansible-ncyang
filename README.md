# Ansible NETCONF/YANG Example

This collection demonstrates two different ways of using NETCONF/YANG with
Ansible. One way using "templated XML" and the other using generated Python classes that are built from YANG models.

Included is a very simple YAML inventory that we'll map onto the `openconfig-interfaces` model and then serialised to XML, which is finally transferred to the device using NETCONF.

To transform our simple YAML inventory in this example to OpenConfig we're
using a custom filter located in `filter_plugins/`.

## Tested with Ansible

This collection has been tested against following Ansible version: **2.10.2**.

## External requirements

In order to generate the Python classes in `filter_plugins/oc_output` you'll
need `pyang` and a recent version `pyangbind`.

https://github.com/robshakir/pyangbind > 0.8.1

## Included content

### Filter plugins

`filter_plugins/oc_intf.py` transforms our YAML inventory to OpenConfig.

## Using the playbooks

- If you're going to run these playbooks you'll need one Juniper router and one Cisco IOS XR router.
- Modify the inventory in `environments/dev/hosts.yml` with their credentials.
- Modify `environments/dev/host_vars/*.yml`
- Look at ansible.cfg and make any additional changes as per required for your environment.

In order for ansible to find the `oc_output` Python module we need to add the `filter_plugins/` folder to the search path.

    ```
    $Â export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`/filter_plugins
    ```

### Display NETCONF schemas and download models from hosts

    ```
    $ ansible-playbook pb-netconf_info.yml
    ```

### Deploy config to IOS XR using OpenConfig

    ```
    $ ansible-playbook pb-cisco.yml
    ```

### Using templated XML over NETCONF

    ```
    $ ansible-playbook pb-juniper.yml
    ```
