# Ansible NETCONF/YANG Example

This collection demonstrates two different ways of using NETCONF/YANG with
Ansible. One way using "templated XML" and the other using generated Python
classes that are built from YANG models.

Included is a very simple YAML inventory that we'll map onto the
`openconfig-interfaces` model and then serialised to XML, which is finally
transferred to the device using NETCONF.

To transform our simple YAML inventory in this example to OpenConfig we're
using a custom filter located in `filter_plugins/`.

## Tested with Ansible

This collection has been tested against following Ansible version: **2.10.2**.

## External requirements

It's possible to run the included playbooks without any network devices and
you'll see the generated config that would be deployed.

In order to generate the Python classes in `filter_plugins/oc_output` you'll
need `pyang` and a recent version `pyangbind`. Included in this repository are
classes generated from OpenConfig dated 2021-05-14. You will need to have the
same or compatible models on the Cisco IOS XR device you're running this
playbook against.

https://github.com/robshakir/pyangbind > 0.8.1

Requires the following collections if you intend to run against devices:
* `community.yang` is required for the `pb-netconf_info` playbook.
* `junipernetworks.junos` is required for the `pb-juniper` playbook.

## Included content

### Filter plugins

`filter_plugins/oc_intf.py` transforms our YAML inventory to OpenConfig.

## Using the playbooks

If you're only interested to see the techniques or you don't have any network
devices. You can still run these as-is and see the generated XML that would be
deployed using NETCONF.

If you are going to run these against actual devices you'll have to modify the
following:

- If you're going to run these playbooks you'll need one Juniper router and one
  Cisco IOS XR router, called `juniper-r1` and `cisco-r1` in the inventory.
- Modify the inventory in `environments/dev/hosts.yml` with their credentials.
- Modify `environments/dev/host_vars/*.yml`
- Look at ansible.cfg and make any additional changes as per required for your environment.

In order for Ansible to find the `oc_output` Python module we need to add the
`filter_plugins/` folder to the search path.

```
$Â export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`/filter_plugins
```

### Display NETCONF schemas and download models from hosts

```
$ ansible-playbook pb-netconf_info.yml
```

### Deploy config to IOS XR using OpenConfig

```
$ ansible-playbook pb-cisco.yml
```

### Deploy config as templated XML over NETCONF

```
$ ansible-playbook pb-juniper.yml
```

## Roadmap

This is provided as an example and is not intended to be maintained or
developed further.

I might add an example using gNMI, only time will tell.
